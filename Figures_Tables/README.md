## Folder description

### AIC_df_Q1 through Q4 txt files

- These text files contain AIC scores for best models, and those <2 AIC away from best models (i.e., basically equivalent) associated with questions 1-4.


### Data_transformations.xlsx

- This Excel file contains data transformations and distribution families for main models in analysis.


### Meteorology

- This folder contains plots conveying weather-related patterns of study area (i.e., precipitation and temperature) generated from Meteorology/Meteorology.rmd script.


### Q1_Q2_ANOVA

- Q1_Dist_ANOVA.png: Image showing ANOVA table from Question 1 where urbanization was quantified using distance from the urban center.
- Q1_Urbscore_ANOVA.png: Image showing ANOVA table from Question 1 where urbanization was quantified using urbanization score.

The same notation style is used for the latter two files (Q2_Dist_ANOVA and Q2_Urbscore_ANOVA).

- The Supplement folder contains models produced using population-level mean data (lm folder) and flower-level or plant-level data (lmer folder).

  - Within the lmer folder:
    - Alternative_Models contains ANOVA tables from Questions 1 and 2 wherein the models were statistically equivalent to the best models (i.e., <2 AIC away from best models). Alt_models_Height contains alternative models for the height analyses (which are not discussed in main text).
    - Best_models_Height contains best models for the height analyses (which are not discussed in main text).
    
  - Within the lm folder, files are named and organized in the same fashion as the lmer folder.

### Q3_ANOVA & Q4_ANOVA

- Contains ANOVA tables for Questions 3-4 as described in section above (Q1_Q2_ANOVA).


### Q1_Regressions_Plants & Q2_Regressions_Plants




### Q3_Regressions_Pollinators & Q4_Regressions_Pollinators




### SampleSiteMaps




### UrbanizationScore
