## Abstract
### 

## Using this code

### Rmd key

* `Q1_Q2_stats.Rmd`: Contains statistics for answering questions 1 and 2.
* `Q1_Q2_figures.Rmd`: Contains figures for questions 1 and 2. This rmd was made separate from the previous `Q1_Q2_stats.Rmd` because it was too big with all of the code in one file.
* `Q3_Q4_stats_figures.Rmd`: Contains statistics and figures for questions 3 and 4.
* `Meteorology.Rmd`: Contains weather-related analyses used to contexualize annual differences in plant reproduction/pollinator ecology.


## How to run this code
1. Open `Q1_Q2_stats.Rmd`.
2. Run the first chunk- "Set up Notebook". This code contains `library()` calls and should be run before running code from any of these other files:

* `Q1_Q2_figures.Rmd`
* `Q3_Q4_stats_figures.Rmd`

3. If interested in running

* `Q1_Q2_stats.Rmd`: go ahead.
* `Q1_Q2_figures.Rmd`: run `Q1_Q2_stats.Rmd` first, then go ahead.
* `Q3_Q4_stats_figures.Rmd`: go ahead.
